# SimonGame
It's a classic Simon Game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this game, the player must follow the sequence of button presses and repeat it correctly. The game gets more challenging as the sequence grows longer.

I wrote the JavaScript part of the game, and the HTML and CSS parts was taken from the Udemy course "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.".

üïπÔ∏è How to Play
When you press any key, the game will start.
The game will show a sequence of colors by flashing buttons.
Your goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
If you make a mistake, the game ends and you'll be given an option to restart.
The game gets progressively harder as the sequence lengthens.
